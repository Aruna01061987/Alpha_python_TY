*** Pytest notes***

Steps in learning pytest:

1. Imported pytest package into my python file(test_demo)--> the file name should either start or end with 'test'':
import pytest

We have to create number of test cases

2. We should add the test methods now. Always a test method should have a naming convention such that the
test name should either start with "test" or end with "test"
ex: test_m1()   or  m1_test()

3. To execute these tests in the added file, just go to the terminal and type --- py.test

Pytest will automatically detect all the test files which have the name starting/ending with test, also will execute
only those methods with same convention as above.

4. Added 2 more python files test_demo2 and test_demo3. Copied few test cases to both the files.

5. When we run the same command again -- py.test, then all the test cases from all the test files will be picked
for execution and will be executed

6.Suppose if you want to execute only single test file then we can specify the test file name after py.test

ex: PS C:\Users\Admin\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\Naveen_pytest> py.test test_demo3.py

            or
PS C:\Users\Admin\PycharmProjects\pythonProject> py.test Naveen_pytest test_demo.py

7. Then we saw how to run test cases with group name, suppose test cases with names having "login" keyword should
be executed, then we use "-k" to run only those test cases

PS C:\Users\Admin\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\Naveen_pytest> py.test -k login
                            or
PS C:\Users\Admin\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\Naveen_pytest> py.test -k login -v

-v means verbose, more details in the report will be displayed

**** Markers*********

1. To run test cases(group of test cases) we can use the concept of markers

just mark the test cases as below:

@pytest.mark.smoke/@pytest.mark.regression

And then to run only those marked test cases, command used is:

PS C:\Users\Admin\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\Naveen_pytest> py.test -m smoke

-m ---represents marked test cases with name smoke and so on

*** To run test in parallel***

Created a new python file test_sample which consists of few methods/tests for invoking browsers with different URLs

when we run this as:

pytest test_sample.py
All the methods/test cases in the file are run sequentially on after the other

Note: Install pytest-xdist package to run the tests in parallel

So, installed the package in the current Naveen_pytest package:

pip install pytest-xdist

And to run the test in parallel, give the following command

pytest test_sample.py -n 5

The number 5 indicates that we want to run 5 different tests in parallel
